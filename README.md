# Python OOP Basics: Simple Class & 4 Key Principles

This repository contains a straightforward introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. 
It includes:

- A simple class example with a full explanation
- The **4 Pillars of OOP** with clear definitions and Python code samples

## üß± Part 1: Simple Python Class Explanation

--- 
python
class Car:
    # Class variable (shared across all objects)
    wheels = 4

    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        # Instance variables (unique to each object)
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.color} {self.brand} is driving.")
| Component                  | Type               | Description                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `class Car:`               | Class definition   | Creates a new class called `Car`            |
| `wheels`                   | Class variable     | Shared by all cars (every car has 4 wheels) |
| `__init__`                 | Constructor        | Initializes object with brand and color     |
| `self.brand`, `self.color` | Instance variables | Data stored **per object**                  |
| `self`                     | Reference          | Refers to the current object                |
| `drive()`                  | Method             | Function defined inside the class           |

my_car = Car("Toyota", "blue")
my_car.drive()   # Output: The blue Toyota is driving.

## üß† Part 2: The 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The 4 core concepts are:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

Let‚Äôs look at each one with a short explanation and example.

---

### üîê 1. Encapsulation

**Definition:** Wrapping data and code together, hiding internal details.

- **Done using private variables (`_` or `__`)**
- **Prevents outside access to sensitive data directly**

**Code Example:**

---
python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private variable

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
acc = BankAccount("John", 1000)
acc.deposit(500)
print(acc.get_balance())     # 1500
# print(acc.__balance)       # ‚ùå Error: can't access private variable

## üß¨ 2. Inheritance
Definition: One class (child) inherits features from another (parent)

- **Promotes code reuse**
- **Child class can override parent methods**

Code Example:
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Some sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Bark")
        
a = Animal()
a.speak()   # Some sound

d = Dog()
d.speak()   # Bark (overridden method)

##  üé≠ 3. Polymorphism
Definition: One interface, many implementations
- **Same method name works differently for different classes**
- **Achieved via method overriding**

Code Example:
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Bird flies high")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Airplane flies faster")

def flying_test(thing):
    thing.fly()

b = Bird()
a = Airplane()

flying_test(b)   # Bird flies high
flying_test(a)   # Airplane flies faster

## üß© 4. Abstraction
Definition: Hiding complex details and showing only essentials
- **Implemented using abstract base classes with @abstractmethod**
- **Forces subclasses to implement certain methods**

Code Example:

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        return self.side * self.side
sq = Square(5)
print(sq.area())  # 25

# s = Shape()    # ‚ùå Error: can't instantiate abstract class


#Hope you have a better understanding now!
